<b>Not Another Lazy Sunday</b> is a web application that allows users to generate random activities for a more productive and fulfilling weekend. The app features a user-friendly interface where users can add, edit, and delete activities. Visit the app: https://not-another-lazy-sunday.netlify.app/.

The app's editor page was developed as a separate page to take advantage of React Router, which allows for a better user experience by enabling seamless navigation between pages without the need for page reloads.

Users are advised to run 'sudo npm install node-sass' if they encounter any issues running the 'run build' command, which is necessary to compile the source code into a production-ready format.
